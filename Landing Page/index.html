        <h2>About Haiko</h2>
        <p>
          Haiko was born in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil on May 28,
          2021. He's a Ragdoll, a cat breed which are know to be a lap cat. In
          fact, the breed supposedly got its name because early litters of the
          docile, friendly cat became limp and floppy like rag dolls when they
          were picked up.
          <br /><br />His Raggy mom is Leona, a lynx Ragdoll. She's stunning and
          also had another 5 kittens other then Haiko. She's such a lovely mom
          and cat and turn her belly up the first time she saw Haiko's human
          family. Aside from its plush fur and large body, the Ragdoll is known
          for its bright blue eyes and color-pointed coat. Ragdolls come in
          several patterns, including colorpoint (no white on their coat),
          bicolor, and mitted (meaning they have white “mittens” on their paws).
          They're born pale, and their coats gradually darken into their
          permanent hues as they grow older.<br /><br />All this text is just

              Cachorro is the oldest of the three. She's a moggy cat with tuxedo
              fur. She has black and white face and he chin has a black spot.
              Also she looks like wearing white socks at her 4 paws, also her
              chest is equally white. We should say she has a dogo personality,
              walking behind you around the house. Also a very talkative cat.

        <h2>Ragdoll History</h2>
        <p>
          The History of Ragdolls is not that extensive because Ragdolls are a
          relatively new breed of cat compared to others. The first Ragdolls
          were bred California in the 1960s by Ann Baker. Baker bred a white
          Angora Persian type cat queen, Josephine, who had a Himalayan coat
          pattern (Siamese) to beautiful longhaired Burmese sire and Birman sire
          males. The breeding resulted in cats of substantial size, non-matting
          coat and a very equable disposition. Josephine’s kittens seemed to
          have a true loving nature and beautiful blue eyes. Baker soon knew
          these kittens were very special. She kept some of them and bred them
          very carefully.
          <br /><br />The kittens with the desired looks were kept and carefully
          line bred to keep the strain pure. In fact, all Ragdolls must be
          descendents of Josephine. No other strain of Persian, Birman, or
          Burmese has been introduced. The traits of the Ragdoll cat can only be
          found in Josephine’s descendents where the history of Ragdolls exists.
          The looks may vary slightly as to pattern or color, but the
          disposition must remain the same to be a Ragdoll. No one, not even the
          originator, can add to the lines at this time, and still have a
          purebred Ragdoll.
          <br />

          The Ragdoll is floppy when relaxed. A Ragdoll’s behavior is highly
          typical of Birman’s who are the most laid-back of cats.<br /><br />All
